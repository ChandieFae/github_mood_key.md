## 🔮 GitHub Mood Key — Vibe Guide for the Repo Realms

Welcome to the mood ring of your repo — a sacred legend to decode the colored dots that follow you like little emotion pixels across GitHub. You are no longer at their mercy. You read them like runes. You wield them like tools.

---

| Dot | Mood | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|
| 🟢 Green | **"At peace"** | All checks passed. Universe aligned. Keep building. ✅ |
| 🟡 Yellow | **"In limbo"** | Something’s still running. ⏳ |
| 🔴 Red | **"Chaos in the temple"** | Something broke.  🔥 |
| 🔵 Blue | **"Unread whispers"** | There’s something new waiting for you. A nudge from the code spirits. 📩 |
| ⚫️ Gray | **"The void is silent"** | No checks, no errors. It neither speaks nor judges. 💤 |

---

> **Note from the Realm:**
> - A red dot does **not** mean you failed. It means you dared.
> - A yellow dot asks for patience, not panic.
> - Blue dots hold secrets.
> - Green? Green means the magic worked.
